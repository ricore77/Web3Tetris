# Tetris Game Architecture: Decoupling Game Logic, Players, and UI

## Overview
This document outlines the **decoupled architecture** of a Tetris game, focusing on separating the **Game Engine**, **Player logic**, and **Board rendering**. This design allows for **flexibility**, **testability**, and **scalability** while maintaining a clean and modular codebase. The goal is to make the game extensible, so you can easily swap components such as players (human, bot) or rendering methods (CLI, React).

## Key Concepts
1. **Game Engine**: Contains the core logic for the Tetris game (pieces, grid, scoring, etc.).
2. **Player Logic**: Handles the decision-making for the player, whether human or bot.
3. **Board**: Responsible for rendering the game state to the user.
4. **Controller**: Orchestrates the game flow, interacting with the player, engine, and board.

## Components

### 1. Game Engine (Core Tetris Logic)
The **GameEngine** class is the heart of the Tetris game. It is responsible for managing the grid, the active piece, piece movement, rotation, line clearing, and scoring. It doesn't have any concept of the player or the user interface.

**Responsibilities**:
- Spawn and move pieces on the grid.
- Detect and handle collisions.
- Track the score and game-over state.
- Handle piece rotation and hard drops.
- Clear full lines and update the grid.

**Benefits**:
- Purely logic-based: The game engine is decoupled from user input, UI, and player behavior.
- Easily testable: Unit tests can focus on the core game mechanics without worrying about rendering or player decisions.

### 2. Player Logic (Human or Bot)
The **Player** is responsible for deciding which move to make during the game. This can either be a human player (via keyboard, mouse, etc.) or a bot (with a strategy or random moves).

**Responsibilities**:
- Provide the next move for the game (e.g., move left, right, rotate, etc.).
- For human players, this is driven by input (e.g., keyboard events or UI actions).
- For bot players, this could involve randomly choosing a move or applying a strategy.

**Interfaces**:
- `IPlayer`: A common interface that both human and bot players implement.

### 3. Board (Rendering the Game State)
The **Board** is responsible for rendering the current game state. This can be done in various ways, such as via a **CLI** (console) or a **React**/graphical user interface.

**Responsibilities**:
- Render the game grid and active pieces.
- Display the score and game-over status.
- Update the UI whenever the game state changes.

**Interfaces**:
- `IBoard`: A common interface for rendering boards across different platforms (CLI, React, etc.).

### 4. Game Controller (Main Loop)
The **GameController** coordinates the game's main loop. It interacts with the **Player** to get the next move, updates the **GameEngine** accordingly, and calls the **Board** to render the state.

**Responsibilities**:
- Interact with the player to get the next move.
- Update the **GameEngine** based on the move.
- Render the game state using the **Board**.
- Start and stop the game loop.
- Handle game over and reset the game when necessary.

## Interaction Flow
1. **Game Starts**: The **GameController** initializes the game, spawns the first piece, and starts the game loop.
2. **Player Makes Move**: The controller calls `player.getNextMove()`, which returns a move (e.g., `"left"`, `"right"`, `"rotate"`). The controller then applies that move to the **GameEngine** (e.g., `engine.movePiece("left")`).
3. **Game Updates**: The controller checks the new game state, and if necessary, it calls the **Board** to render the updated state.
4. **Game Over**: If the **GameEngine** detects the game is over, the controller stops the game loop, and the **Board** renders the game-over message.

## Benefits of This Architecture

### 1. Separation of Concerns (SoC)
- **GameEngine**: Focuses on the game logic and mechanics.
- **Player**: Handles decision-making (human or bot).
- **Board**: Responsible for displaying the game.
- **Controller**: Orchestrates interactions between the player, engine, and board.

### 2. Testability
- Unit tests can focus on each component independently, ensuring the game logic, player decisions, and rendering are all properly tested.

### 3. Flexibility and Extensibility
- You can easily swap or extend components without affecting others (e.g., change the **Player** or switch to a different **Board** without changing the core game logic).

### 4. Modularity
- Allows for adding new features (e.g., new player types, additional game mechanics) without disrupting the core functionality.

### 5. Scalability
- The architecture can scale with new features like multiplayer support, multiple game modes, or difficulty levels for AI players.

### 6. Improved User Experience
- By decoupling logic from rendering, you can easily adapt the game to different user interfaces (CLI, React, mobile apps) and user input methods.

## Conclusion
This architecture ensures that the Tetris game is **modular**, **flexible**, and **extensible**. It allows for easy swapping of different **players**, **UI** implementations, and provides a clean and scalable structure for future enhancements.
